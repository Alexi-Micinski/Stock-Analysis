# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Steve’s parents are passionate about green energy, especially as fossil fuels become more scarce and energy demands shift towards renewable energy sources such as hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, wind energy, and bioenergy. They have only invested in one renewable energy company, DQ. Steve is concerned that their investments aren’t more diversified. Steve has started researching other companies in addition to DQ and put together the stock data.

Steve is interested in the total daily volume, or total number of shares traded in a day, and yearly return, or percentage difference from the beginning to year end, for the stocks he’s investigating.

First, Steve wanted to investigate the performance of DQ in 2018. Performance was measured by calculating the yearly return: percentage increase or decrease throughout the year. We found that Daqo’s stocks fell 63% in 2018, so they may not be the best option for Steve’s parents.

Other stocks were analyzed since Daqo didn’t seem like the best fit for Steve’s parents. The work that was used to create the DQ analysis was repurposed to analyze the other stocks for any year. Formatting was added to create an easier to read output, and a script was added to see how fast VBA executed the code.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.


### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
